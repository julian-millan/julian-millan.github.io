## Academic and Professional Projects
### Caltech ME 72 Senior Design Capstone (September 2024 - March 2025) 

My Caltech Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone was a 6 month long group project. I was my team's software/electronics lead and a key contributor to mechanical design and fabrication.
The project was modeled after industry standards, requiring strict budget management with usage of Bills of Materials (BOMs), a PDR and CDR, demonstration timelines, and strict keeping of an engineering notebook. 

As software and electronics lead, I solely wrote the driving code and remote control interface for the robot. I also selected, designed, and assembled all of the mechatronics in the robot. The code for this robot can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/julian-millan). Our team won second place in the entire competition, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/KheHtUqBbpU?si=4mcJCXxG_Whs3pPR).

### Caltech ME/CS/EE 169 Final Project (April - June 2024)
This project involved designing a fully autonomous car capable of solving a known and unknown maze. I led both the robot fabrication and the design the full software stack. I utilized skills in SLAM and robotic planning. A project demonstration video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/JR84L-bYDIU).

### Caltech ME/EE/CS 134 Final Project (January - March 2024) 
This group project, we were given the task to design a 7-DOF arm for a complex task with recovery modes. I was the mechanical design lead and a key contributor to the programming of the recovery modes. As the mechanical lead, the design and fabrication was my primary responsibility, and I utilized skills in 3D printing, inverse kinematics, 3D CAD, machining, and beam bending analysis. This led to a successful creation of the robot, that was able to interact with other game players and employ various recovery behaviors in both typical gameplay scenarios and scenarios involving unexpected behaviors from other players. The demo video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/ghnqkQhqNAI) and more details on the work done can be found in our final report.

## Academic and Professional Projects
### Caltech ME 72 Senior Design Capstone (September 2024 - March 2025) 

My Caltech Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone was a 6 month long group project. I was my team's software/electronics lead and a key contributor to mechanical design and fabrication.
The project was modeled after industry standards, requiring strict budget management with usage of Bills of Materials (BOMs), a PDR and CDR, demonstration timelines, and strict keeping of an engineering notebook. 

As software and electronics lead, I solely wrote the driving code and remote control interface for the robot. I also selected, designed, and assembled all of the mechatronics in the robot. The code for this robot can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/julian-millan). Our team won second place in the entire competition, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/KheHtUqBbpU?si=4mcJCXxG_Whs3pPR).

### Caltech ME/CDS 234a Final Project (March 2025)
This was a shorter solo project, where I examined rescue robotics in simulation within the context of robotic planning. I employed skills in RRT, Kalman Filtering, Python, and general motion planning. I was able to successfully design a robotic planner that could be robust against a variety of environments and "signal interference". A video demonstration can be found [here](https://youtu.be/v9ArnxscL8A?si=ZjikmbmaAAM8VT9u).

### Caltech ME/CS/EE 169 Final Project (April - June 2024)
This project involved designing a fully autonomous car capable of solving a known and unknown maze. I led both the robot fabrication and the design the full software stack. I utilized skills in SLAM, low level mobile robotics programming, collision avoidance and dynamic robotic planning. A project demonstration video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/JR84L-bYDIU).

### Caltech ME/EE/CS 134 Final Project (January - March 2024) 
This group project, we were given the task to design a 7-DOF arm for a complex task with recovery modes. I was the mechanical design lead and a key contributor to the programming of the recovery modes. As the mechanical lead, the design and fabrication was my primary responsibility, and I utilized skills in 3D printing, inverse kinematics, 3D CAD, machining, and beam bending analysis. 

This led to a successful creation of the robot, that was able to interact with other game players and employ various recovery behaviors in both typical gameplay scenarios and scenarios involving unexpected behaviors from other players. The demo video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/ghnqkQhqNAI) and more details on the work done can be found in our <a href="/assets/ME134_Final_Report (1).pdf" class="btn" target="_blank">final report (PDF)</a>.

### Caltech ME/CS/EE 133b Final Project (March 2024) 
This was a shorter (about three weeks long) project at the end of my undergraduate robotic planning class. I worked in a trio on testing various planning algorithms in a 2D maze. In particular, we tested conventional RRT and EST planning algorithms against modified RRT and EST planners adapted to go 90 degrees significantly more often than usual. A wrinkle we added was the existence of "locked doors", requiring our planner to acquire the right keys before proceeding.

I worked primarily on the development of the RRT and EST 90 degree planners. A video of our findings can be found [here](https://youtu.be/bAizg2_v2O0) and more details on each of the algorithms can be found in our <a href="/assets/CS 133b Final Project Report.pdf" class="btn" target="_blank">final report (PDF)</a>.

### Caltech ME/CS/EE 133a Final Project (December 2023)
This was another shorter partner project that looked to apply fundamental robotic kinematics and ROS2 knowledge in a creative direction using a known pre-made robot model. This was a relatively simple and lighthearted project meant to showcase our skills in the fundamental aspects of robotics. I applied skills in Linux, ROS2, Python, robot kinematics, and more. A video of the virtual demonstration can be found [here](https://youtu.be/MOWTQnGmksY).

## Academic and Professional Projects
### ME 72 Senior Design Capstone (September 2024 - March 2025) 

My Caltech Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone was a 6 month long group project. I was my team's software/electronics lead and a key contributor to mechanical design and fabrication.
The project was modeled after industry standards, requiring strict budget management with usage of Bills of Materials (BOMs), a PDR and CDR, demonstration timelines, and strict keeping of an engineering notebook. As software and electronics lead, I solely wrote the driving code and remote control interface for the robot. I also selected, designed, and assembled all of the mechatronics in the robot. The code for this robot can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/julian-millan). Our team won second place in the entire competition, which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/KheHtUqBbpU?si=4mcJCXxG_Whs3pPR).

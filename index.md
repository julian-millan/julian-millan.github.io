I am a first year Master of Science in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am currently doing research on Human-Robot Interaction in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) with the [Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) lab](https://rchi-lab.github.io/), focusing on assistive robotics and communication of robotic intent.

I previously graduated from the [California Institute of Technology (Caltech)](https://www.caltech.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. During my time at Caltech, I conducted Robotic Machine Learning research with the [Autonomous Robotics and Controls Lab (ARCL)](https://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/) and Robotic Hardware research with the [Advanced Mechanical Experimental Robotics (AMBER) Lab](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/).

## Research

## Curent Master's Research
My current research with the RCHI Lab focuses on bidirectional communication between assistive robots and their users. My focus is on improving the capability of assistive robots to navigate roadblocks they encounter in their tasks. 

### Second SURF Project (June-August 2024) [Caltech]
### Training a Biped to Walk with Behavior Cloning and Reinforcement Learning 
With Caltech's Autonomous Robotics and Controls Lab (ARCL) led by Professor Soon-Jo Chung

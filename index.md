I am a first year Master of Science in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am currently doing research on Human-Robot Interaction in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) with the [Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) lab](https://rchi-lab.github.io/), focusing on assistive robotics and communication of robotic intent.

I previously graduated from the [California Institute of Technology (Caltech)](https://www.caltech.edu/) with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. During my time at Caltech, I conducted Robotic Machine Learning research with the [Autonomous Robotics and Controls Lab (ARCL)](https://aerospacerobotics.caltech.edu/) and Robotic Hardware research with the [Advanced Mechanical Experimental Robotics (AMBER) Lab](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/).

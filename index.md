**I am looking for 1 PhD student to join our research group in Fall 2025**. If you are a recently admitted CMU PhD student, please email me! zackory@cmu.edu

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in [The Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), where I lead the [Robotic Caregiving and Human Interaction (RCHI) Lab](https://rchi-lab.github.io).
My research focuses on developing new robot learning, mobile manipulation, and sensing methods, with applications in physical human-robot interaction and healthcare.

Previously, I received my PhD in Robotics at Georgia Tech advised by [Charlie Kemp](https://charliekemp.com).
